## What This Organ Does

ORGAN-II is the art-making engine of the [organvm system](https://github.com/meta-organvm). Where ORGAN-I (Theoria) develops the epistemological and ontological frameworks, Poiesis translates those abstractions into lived creative practice — generative visuals, algorithmic music, choreographic interfaces, interactive theatre, and real-time performance systems that blur the boundary between artist and audience.

The work here spans the full creative pipeline: from low-level audio synthesis and rendering engines, through SDKs and client libraries, to complete performance platforms and audience-facing installations. Every repository is documented as a portfolio piece — written for grant reviewers, collaborators, and hiring managers, not just developers.

## The Omni-Dromenon Engine

At the center of ORGAN-II sits **[metasystem-master](https://github.com/organvm-ii-poiesis/metasystem-master)** — the Omni-Dromenon Engine. This is the canonical monorepo that consolidates ORGAN-II's real-time performance system: audience voting, generative state machines, choreographic routing, and multi-modal output. It is the flagship repository and the reference implementation for how theory becomes performance.

## How ORGAN-II Fits the System

ORGAN-II occupies the middle position in the core creative pipeline:

```
ORGAN-I (Theoria) ──→ ORGAN-II (Poiesis) ──→ ORGAN-III (Ergon)
   Theory                  Art                  Commerce
```

**Receives from Theory:** Epistemological frameworks, recursive structures, ontological models from [organvm-i-theoria](https://github.com/organvm-i-theoria) become the conceptual scaffolding for art systems. No back-edges — Poiesis consumes theory, never dictates it.

**Feeds Commerce:** Validated creative systems graduate into productized offerings in [organvm-iii-ergon](https://github.com/organvm-iii-ergon) — SaaS platforms, B2B tools, client-facing products. Art proves the concept; commerce scales it.

**Orchestrated by:** [organvm-iv-taxis](https://github.com/organvm-iv-taxis) governs cross-organ routing and promotion state machines.
